# Travelling_Salesman_Problem
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in optimization and computer science. Imagine a salesman who needs to visit a list of cities, starting and ending at the same city. The challenge is to find the shortest possible route that allows the salesman to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting point.

# Overview
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known problem in the field of computer science and mathematics. In essence, it involves finding the shortest possible route for a salesman to take in order to visit a given set of cities, each exactly once, and then return to the starting city. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled or the cost incurred
